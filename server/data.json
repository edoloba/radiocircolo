Her resolutely punk arrangements blend the tenderness of her accent with incisive synthesizer rhythms, a velvet hand behind the switchblade. Cristina gives form to the inconveniences of human relationships that overwhelm us: sorrow, black moods… but paradoxically manages to make something very beautiful out of it.

      "description": "Steve Pepe is the latest incarnation of Manuel Cascone, a musician who has been a fixture of the underground scene of Rome since the mid-2000s. After debuting on Hivern Discs in 2018 with Danza Moderna, he recently released a great album on Macadam Mambo called 2020. Using analog equipment and acoustic instruments, his sound can be seen as a kind of dance music trying to deconstruct some of its automatisms. The result is something that feels too alive to enclose it in a genre. Music that’s playful and transcendental at the same time, with the kind of natural and effortless feel that’s so hard to achieve. \nRecorded in Rome at Merende, January 2020 – Angelo Mai. \nPhoto credits: Valentina Pascarella",

      "description": "Entering the world of Massimo Amato is like suddenly being transported in an earthy yet magical dimension full of ecstatic suggestions. His compositions captured us from the beginning, blending elements of experimental nature with ethereal atmospheres and melodies that know how to speak to the heart. In activity since the 80’s, he became known for making use of natural instruments in conjunction with analogue synthesisers, featuring collaborations with a series of excellent musicians including Gigi Masin. The hands on approach of Massimo gave him the reputation of an “electroacoustic sound sculptor”. \nAfter releasing material under his Mono-Drone alias, he started a collaboration with Affordable Inner Space label that pressed both La Centrale Elettrica and In the Mood albums. He recently published a new album on Pregnant Void called Lost Sunsets. His love for ethnic, spiritual funk and jazz made him share here a small selection of records to offer us a wonderful escape into a serene and patient place.",
